## 📊 PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS (Reality Check)

### Backtesting vs Live Trading
```
Typical Performance Degradation:

Technical Analysis:
  Backtest:    0.13% monthly
  Live:        0.08-0.10% monthly (80% of backtest)
  Reason:      Slippage, fees, market noise

Machine Learning:
  Backtest:    1.18% monthly
  Live:        0.80-1.00% monthly (70-85% of backtest)
  Reason:      Market regime changes, fees, slippage, overfitting edge cases

Hybrid:
  Backtest:    0.71% monthly
  Live:        0.55-0.65% monthly (75-90% of backtest)
  Reason:      Conservative approach degrades less
```

### Annual Projections (Conservative)
```
Capital: $100 with 10x leverage

Technical Analysis:
  Monthly:  0.08% × $100 = $0.08
  Annual:   $0.08 × 12 = $0.96 (0.96% ROI)
  Verdict:  Not worth it without large capital

Machine Learning:
  Monthly:  0.90% × $100 = $0.90
  Annual:   $0.90 × 12 = $10.80 (10.8% ROI)
  Verdict:  Decent returns, worth the effort

Hybrid:
  Monthly:  0.60% × $100 = $0.60
  Annual:   $0.60 × 12 = $7.20 (7.2% ROI)
  Verdict:  Good balanced returns

With Compound Growth (ML):
  Month 1:  $100 → $100.90
  Month 2:  $100.90 → $101.81
  Month 3:  $101.81 → $102.73
  ...
  Month 12: $111.35 (11.35% ROI with compounding!)
```
